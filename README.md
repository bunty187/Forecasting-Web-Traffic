# Forecasting-Web-Traffic(Time Series Forecasting)
(This notebook will help you understand how to formulate and build a deep learning model for time series data.)


## Understanding the Problem Statement
In order to dynamically manage resources to run your website, you need to have an idea about the number of visitors who might arrive at your website at different points in time. So, the problem at hand is to predict the web traffic or number of sessions in the next hour based on the historical data.

### Step in Forecasting-Web_Traffic
1. Load the dataset
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Preparation
4. Split the dataset into train and validation set
5. Normalize the input and output data as it speeds up the training process
6. Model Building
7. Comparision with base model
8. Forecasting
